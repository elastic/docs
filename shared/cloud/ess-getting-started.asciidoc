There's no faster way to get started than with our hosted {ess} on Elastic Cloud:

. {ess-trial}[Get a free trial].

. Log into {ess-console}[Elastic Cloud].

. Click *Create deployment*.

. Select a solution and give your deployment a name.

. Click *Create deployment* and copy the password for the `elastic` user and Cloud ID information.

That’s it! Now that you are up and running, it’s time to get some data into {kib}. Click *Launch Kibana*.
