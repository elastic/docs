//== Get started with {ess}

There's no faster way to get started than with our hosted {ess} on Elastic Cloud:

. {ess-trial}[Get a free trial]. 

. Log into {ess-console}[Elastic Cloud].

. Click *Create deployment* and give your deployment a name.
. Optional: The default  options are great for getting started, but you can add more features by clicking *Customize deployment*.
. Click *Create deployment* and copy down the password for the `elastic` user and Cloud ID information.  

That’s it! Now that you are up and running, it’s time to get some data into {kib}. Click *Launch Kibana*.
