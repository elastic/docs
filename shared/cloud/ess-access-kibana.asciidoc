//== Access Kibana

Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. Kibana is included with your subscription.

To access Kibana:

. Log into {ess-console}[Elastic Cloud].
+
TIP: If you don't have access, {ess-trial}[get a free trial].

. Select your Elasticsearch Service deployment.

. Under *Applications*, click the Kibana *Launch* link and wait for Kibana to open.

. Log into Kibana as the `elastic` superuser to try it out. (Don't have the password? Reset it on the *Security* page for your deployment.

// In production systems, you might need to control what Elasticsearch data users can access through Kibana, so you need create credentials that can be used to access the necessary Elasticsearch resources. This means granting read access to the necessary indexes, as well as access to update the `.kibana` index.
