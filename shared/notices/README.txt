This directory contains boilerplate notices for versions that have reached 
the end of their maintenance period or end of life. 
For the official Elastic product maintenance/EOL schedule, see https://www.elastic.co/support/eol. 

To use, set the version and product name and save as page_header.html
alongside the book's index.asciidoc file. 

Note that you can create a custom page header for any version of a book. 
The header must be valid HTML and cannot contain comments.
