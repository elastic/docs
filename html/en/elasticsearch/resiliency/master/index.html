Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene to protect your data.  As with any distributed
system, Elasticsearch is complex and has many moving parts, each of which can
encounter edge cases that require proper handling.  Our resiliency project is
an ongoing effort to find and fix these edge cases. If you want to keep up
with all this project on GitHub, see our issues list under the tag
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues?q=label%3Aresiliency" target="_top">resiliency</a>.</p><p>While GitHub is great for sharing our work, it can be difficult to get an
overview of the current state of affairs and the previous work that has been
done from an issues list. This page provides an overview of all the
resiliency-related issues that we are aware of, improvements that have already
been made and current in-progress work. We’ve also listed some historical
improvements throughout this page to provide the full context.</p><p>If you’re interested in more on how we approach ensuring resiliency in
Elasticsearch, you may be interested in Igor Motov’s recent talk

Elasticsearch to simulate failures and randomize configuration to
produce extreme conditions. In addition, our users are an important
source of information on unexpected edge cases and your bug reports

It is not a single test and is regularly adapted
to create new scenarios. We have currently ported all published Jepsen scenarios that deal with loss of acknowledged writes to our testing
framework. As the Jepsen tests evolve, we will continue porting new scenarios that are not covered yet. We are committed to investigating
all new scenarios and will report issues that we find on this page and in our GitHub repository.</p><h3><a id="_repeated_network_partitions_can_cause_cluster_state_updates_to_be_lost_status_ongoing"></a>Repeated network partitions can cause cluster state updates to be lost (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>During a networking partition, cluster state updates (like mapping changes or shard assignments)
are committed if a majority of the master-eligible nodes received the update correctly. This means that the current master has access
to enough nodes in the cluster to continue to operate correctly. When the network partition heals, the isolated nodes catch
up with the current state and receive the previously missed changes. However, if a second partition happens while the cluster
is still recovering from the previous one <span class="strong"><strong>and</strong></span> the old master falls on the minority side, it may be that a new master is elected
which has not yet catch up. If that happens, cluster state updates can be lost.</p><p>This problem is mostly fixed by <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20384" target="_top">#20384</a> (v5.0.0), which takes committed cluster state updates into account during master
election. This considerably reduces the chance of this rare problem occurring but does not fully mitigate it. If the second partition
happens concurrently with a cluster state update and blocks the cluster state commit message from reaching a majority of nodes, it may be
that the in flight update will be lost. If the now-isolated master can still acknowledge the cluster state update to the client this
will amount to the loss of an acknowledged change. Fixing that last scenario needs considerable work and is currently targeted at (v6.0.0).</p><h3><a id="_better_request_retry_mechanism_when_nodes_are_disconnected_status_ongoing"></a>Better request retry mechanism when nodes are disconnected (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>If the node holding a primary shard is disconnected for whatever reason, the
coordinating node retries the request on the same or a new primary shard.  In
certain rare conditions, where the node disconnects and immediately
reconnects, it is possible that the original request has already been
successfully applied but has not been reported, resulting in duplicate
requests. This is particularly true when retrying bulk requests, where some
actions may  have completed and some may not have.</p><p>An optimization which disabled the existence check for documents indexed with
auto-generated IDs could result in the creation of duplicate documents. This
optimization has been removed. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9468" target="_top">#9468</a> (STATUS: DONE, v1.5.0)</p><p>Further issues remain with the retry mechanism:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

During that time it will continue
indexing writes locally, thereby updating document versions. When it tries to replicate the operation, however, it will discover that it is
partitioned away. It won’t acknowledge the write and will wait until the partition is resolved to negotiate with the master on how to proceed.
The master will decide to either fail any replicas which failed to index the operations on the primary or tell the primary that it has to
step down because a new primary has been chosen in the meantime. Since the old primary has already written documents, clients may already have read from
the old primary before it shuts itself down. The version numbers of these reads may not be unique if the new primary has already accepted
writes for the same document (see <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19269" target="_top">#19269</a>).</p><p>We are currently implementing Sequence numbers <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10708" target="_top">#10708</a> which better track primary changes. Sequence numbers thus provide a basis
for uniquely identifying writes even in the presence of network partitions and will replace <code class="literal">_version</code> in operations that require this.</p><h3><a id="_relocating_shards_omitted_by_reporting_infrastructure_status_ongoing"></a>Relocating shards omitted by reporting infrastructure (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Indices stats and indices segments requests reach out to all nodes that have shards of that index.

The length of the window is dependent on the type of the partition. This window is extremely small if a socket is broken. More adversarial partitions, for example, silently dropping requests without breaking the socket can take longer (up to 3x30s using current defaults).</p><p>If the node hosts a primary shard at the moment of partition, and ends up being isolated from the cluster (which could have resulted in <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2488" target="_top">split-brain</a> before), some documents that are being indexed into the primary may be lost if they fail to reach one of the allocated replicas (due to the partition) and that replica is later promoted to primary by the master (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7572" target="_top">#7572</a>).
To prevent this situation, the primary needs to wait for the master to acknowledge replica shard failures before acknowledging the write to the client. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14252" target="_top">#14252</a></p><h3><a id="_safe_primary_relocations_status_unreleased_v5_0_0"></a>Safe primary relocations (STATUS: UNRELEASED, v5.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>When primary relocation completes, a cluster state is propagated that deactivates the old primary and marks the new primary as active. As
cluster state changes are not applied synchronously on all nodes, there can be a time interval where the relocation target has processed the
cluster state and believes to be the active primary and the relocation source has not yet processed the cluster state update and still
believes itself to be the active primary. This means that an index request that gets routed to the new primary does not get replicated to
the old primary (as it has been deactivated from point of view of the new primary). If a subsequent read request gets routed to the old
primary, it cannot see the indexed document. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15900" target="_top">#15900</a></p><p>In the reverse situation where a cluster state update that completes primary relocation is first applied on the relocation source and then
on the relocation target, each of the nodes believes the other to be the active primary. This leads to the issue of indexing requests
chasing the primary being quickly sent back and forth between the nodes, potentially making them both go OOM. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12573" target="_top">#12573</a></p><h3><a id="_do_not_allow_stale_shards_to_automatically_be_promoted_to_primary_status_unreleased_v5_0_0"></a>Do not allow stale shards to automatically be promoted to primary (STATUS: UNRELEASED, v5.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>In some scenarios, after the loss of all valid copies, a stale replica shard can be automatically assigned as a primary, preferring old data
to no data at all (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14671" target="_top">#14671</a>). This can lead to a loss of acknowledged writes if the valid copies are not lost but are rather
temporarily unavailable. Allocation IDs (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14739" target="_top">#14739</a>) solve this issue by tracking non-stale shard copies in the cluster and using
this tracking information to allocate primary shards. When all shard copies are lost or only stale ones available, Elasticsearch will wait
for one of the good shard copies to reappear. In case where all good copies are lost, a manual override command can be used to allocate a
stale shard copy.</p><h3><a id="_make_index_creation_resilient_to_index_closing_and_full_cluster_crashes_status_unreleased_v5_0_0"></a>Make index creation resilient to index closing and full cluster crashes (STATUS: UNRELEASED, v5.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Recovering an index requires a quorum (with an exception for 2) of shard copies to be available to allocate a primary. This means that
a primary cannot be assigned if the cluster dies before enough shards have been allocated (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126" target="_top">#9126</a>). The same happens if an index
is closed before enough shard copies were started, making it impossible to reopen the index (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15281" target="_top">#15281</a>).
Allocation IDs (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14739" target="_top">#14739</a>) solve this issue by tracking allocated shard copies in the cluster. This makes it possible to safely
recover an index in the presence of a single shard copy. Allocation IDs can also distinguish the situation where an index has been created
but none of the shards have been started. If such an index was inadvertently closed before at least one shard could be started, a fresh
shard will be allocated upon reopening the index.</p><h3><a id="_use_two_phase_commit_for_cluster_state_publishing_status_unreleased_v5_0_0"></a>Use two phase commit for Cluster State publishing (STATUS: UNRELEASED, v5.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>A master node in Elasticsearch continuously <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-zen.html#fault-detection" target="_top">monitors the cluster nodes</a>

a join request to the newly elected master node. Instead of immediately processing the election result, the elected master
node should wait for the incoming joins from other nodes, thus validating that the result of the election is properly applied. As soon as enough

That cache is limited in size
(10% of node’s memory by default) and is being evicted based on a least recently
used policy. The amount of memory used by the cache depends on two primary
components - the values it stores and the keys associated with them. Calculating
the memory footprint of the values is easy enough but the keys accounting is
trickier to achieve as they are, by default, raw Lucene objects. This is largely
not a problem as the keys are dominated by the values. However, recent
optimizations in Lucene have changed the balance causing the filter cache to
grow beyond it’s size.</p><p>As a temporary solution, we introduced a minimum weight of 1k for each cache entry.

We invested massively into our testing infrastructure, running our tests continuously on different operating systems, bare metal hardware and cloud environments, all while randomizing JVMs and their settings.</p><p>Yet, backwards compatibility testing was a very manual thing until we released a pretty <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6393" target="_top">insane bug</a> with Elasticsearch 1.2. We tried to fix places where the absolute value of a number was negative (a documented behavior of Math.abs(int) in Java) and missed that the fix for this also changed the result of our routing function. No matter how much randomization we applied to the tests, we didn’t catch this particular failure. We always had backwards compatibility tests on our list of things to do, but didn’t have them in place back then.</p><p>We recently tweaked our testing infrastructure to be able to run tests against a hybrid cluster composed of a released version of Elasticsearch and our current stable branch. This test pattern allowed us to mimic typical upgrade scenarios like rolling upgrades, index backwards compatibility and recovering from old to new nodes.</p><p>Now, even the simplest test that relies on routing fails against 1.2.0, which is exactly we were aiming for. The test would not have caught the aforementioned <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6393" target="_top">routing bug</a> before releasing 1.2.0, but it immediately saved us from <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6660" target="_top">another problem</a> in the stable branch.</p><p>The work on our testing infrastructure is more than just issue prevention, it allows us to develop and test upgrade paths, introduce new features and evolve indexing over time.

Although some Linux users reported this behavior, it appears the problem occurs more frequently when running Windows. We traced the source of the problem to the fact that when serializing documents to the transaction log, the Operating System can actually write only part of the document before returning from the write call. We can now detect this situation and make sure that the entire document is properly written.

This architecture caused delays in failure detection, potentially causing unneeded failures of other incoming requests. In rare cases, such as concurrency racing conditions or certain network partitions configurations, we could lose these failure notifications. We solved this issue by locally failing shards upon indexing errors.

While it was always possible to make backups of Elasticsearch, the Snapshot/Restore API made the backup process much easier.</p><p>The backup process is incremental, making it very efficient since only files changed since the last backup are copied. Even with this efficiency introduced, each snapshot contains a full picture of the cluster at the moment when backup started. The restore API allows speedy recovery of a full cluster as well as selected indices.</p><p>Since that first release in version 1.0, the API has continued to evolve. In version 1.1.0, we added a new snapshot status API that allows users to monitor the snapshot process. In 1.3.0 we added the ability to <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6457" target="_top">restore indices without their aliases</a> and in 1.4 we are planning to add the ability to <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6368" target="_top">restore partial snapshots</a>.</p><p>The Snapshot/Restore API supports a number of different repository types for storing backups.

This change makes garbage collection easier by limiting fragmentation, since all pages have the same size and are recycled. It also allows managing the size of the cache not based on the number of objects it contains, but on the memory that it uses.</p><p>These pages are used for two main purposes: implementing higher level data structures such as hash tables that are used internally by aggregations to eg. map terms to counts, as well as reusing memory in the translog/transport layer as detailed in issue <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5691" target="_top">#5691</a>.</p><h3><a id="_dedicated_master_nodes_resiliency_status_done_v1_0_0"></a>Dedicated Master Nodes Resiliency (STATUS: DONE, v1.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>In order to run a more resilient cluster, we recommend running dedicated master nodes to ensure master nodes are not affected by resources consumed by data nodes.
