stand out as a force dealing with a disproportionately large number of bicycle thefts. Ordinarily, bicycle thefts represent only 1% of crimes (66799/5064554)
but for the British Transport Police, who handle crime on railways and stations, 7% of crimes (3640/47347) is
a bike theft. This is a significant seven-fold increase in frequency and so this anomaly was highlighted as the top crime type.</p><p>The problem with using a query to spot anomalies is it only gives us one subset to use for comparisons.

You now have a ranked list of badly-categorized movies that you should reclassify or at least remove from the "familyFriendly" category.</p><p>The significance score from each term can also provide a useful <code class="literal">boost</code> setting to sort matches.
Using the <code class="literal">minimum_should_match</code> setting of the <code class="literal">terms</code> query with the keywords will help control the balance of precision/recall in the result set i.e

However, sometimes it may prove useful to use a narrower background set as the basis for comparisons.
For example, a query on documents relating to "Madrid" in an index with content from all over the world might reveal that "Spanish"
was a significant term. This may be true but if you want some more focused terms you could use a <code class="literal">background_filter</code>
on the term <span class="emphasis"><em>spain</em></span> to establish a narrower set of documents as context. With this as a background "Spanish" would now
be seen as commonplace and therefore not as significant as words like "capital" that relate more strongly with Madrid.
Note that using a background filter will slow things down - each term’s background frequency must now be derived on-the-fly from filtering posting lists rather than reading the index’s pre-computed count for a term.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_limitations_5"></a>Limitations<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/reference/aggregations/bucket/significantterms-aggregation.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_significant_terms_must_be_indexed_values"></a>Significant terms must be indexed values<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/reference/aggregations/bucket/significantterms-aggregation.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h4></div></div></div><p>Unlike the terms aggregation it is currently not possible to use script-generated terms for counting purposes.
Because of the way the significant_terms aggregation must consider both <span class="emphasis"><em>foreground</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>background</em></span> frequencies
it would be prohibitively expensive to use a script on the entire index to obtain background frequencies for comparisons.
Also DocValues are not supported as sources of term data for similar reasons.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_no_analysis_of_floating_point_fields"></a>No analysis of floating point fields<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/reference/aggregations/bucket/significantterms-aggregation.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h4></div></div></div><p>Floating point fields are currently not supported as the subject of significant_terms analysis.
While integer or long fields can be used to represent concepts like bank account numbers or category numbers which
can be interesting to track, floating point fields are usually used to represent quantities of something.

top-most aggregation - in this scenario the <span class="emphasis"><em>foreground</em></span> set is exactly the same as the <span class="emphasis"><em>background</em></span> set and
so there is no difference in document frequencies to observe and from which to make sensible suggestions.</p><p>Another consideration is that  the significant_terms aggregation produces many candidate results at shard level
that are only later pruned on the reducing node once all statistics from all shards are merged. As a result,
it can be inefficient and costly in terms of RAM to embed large child aggregations under a significant_terms
aggregation that later discards many candidate terms. It is advisable in these cases to perform two searches - the first to provide a rationalized list of
significant_terms and then add this shortlist of terms to a second query to go back and fetch the required child aggregations.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_approximate_counts"></a>Approximate counts<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/reference/aggregations/bucket/significantterms-aggregation.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h4></div></div></div><p>The counts of how many documents contain a term provided in results are based on summing the samples returned from each shard and

If the number of unique terms is greater than <code class="literal">size</code>, the returned list can be slightly off and not accurate
(it could be that the term counts are slightly off and it could even be that a term that should have been in the top

a consolidated review by the reducing node before the final selection. Obviously large candidate term lists
will cause extra network traffic and RAM usage so this is  quality/cost trade off that needs to be balanced.
