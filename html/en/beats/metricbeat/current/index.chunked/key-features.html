When it cannot retrieve metrics, it
sends error events. The error is not simply a flag, but a full error string that is
created during fetching from the host systems. This enables you to monitor not
only the metrics, but also any errors that occur during metrics monitoring.</p><p>Because you see the full error message, you can track down the error faster.
Metricbeat is installed locally on the host machine, which means that you can
differentiate errors that happen locally from other issues, such as network problems.</p><p>Each metricset is retrieved based on a predefined period, so when Metricbeat fails to
retrieve metrics for more than one interval, you can infer that there is potentially
something wrong with the host or host connectivity.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="no-aggregations"></a>No Aggregations When Data is Fetched<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/5.3/metricbeat/docs/how-metricbeat-works.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Metricbeat doesn’t do aggregations like gauge, sum, counters, and so on. Metricbeat
sends the raw data retrieved from the host to the output for processing. When using
Elasticsearch, this has the advantage that all raw data is available on the
Elasticsearch host for drilling down into the details, and the data can be
reprocessed at any time. It also reduces the complexity of Metricbeat.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="more-than-numbers"></a>Sends More Than Just Numbers<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/5.3/metricbeat/docs/how-metricbeat-works.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Metricbeat sends more than just numbers. The metrics that Metricbeat sends can also
contain strings to report status information. This is useful when you’re using
Elasticsearch to store the metrics data. Because each metricset has a predefined
structure, Elasticsearch knows in advance which types will be stored in
Elasticsearch, and it can optimize storage.</p><p>Basic meta information about each metric (such as the host) is also sent as part
of each event.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="multiple-events-in-one"></a>Multiple Metrics in One Event<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/5.3/metricbeat/docs/how-metricbeat-works.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Rather than containing a single metric, each event created by Metricbeat
contains a list of metrics. This means that you can retrieve all the metrics
in a single request to the host system, resulting in less load on the host
system. If you are sending the metrics to Elasticsearch as the output,
Elasticsearch can directly store and query the metrics as a nested
JSON document, making it very efficient for sending metrics data to Elasticsearch.</p><p>Because the full raw event data is available, Metricbeat or Elasticsearch can
do any required transformations on the data later. For example, if you need to
store data in the <a class="ulink" href="http://metrics20.org/" target="_top">Metrics2.0</a> format, you could generate
the format out of the existing event by splitting up the full event into multiple
metrics2.0 events.</p><p>Meta information about the type of each metric is stored in the mapping
template. Meta information that is common to all metric events, such as host and
timestamp, is part of the event structure itself  and is only stored once for
all events in the metricset.</p><p>Having all the related metrics in a single event also makes it easier to look
at other values when one of the metrics for a service seems off.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="error-event-structure.html">
