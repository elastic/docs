# This builds a "base" image that contains dependencies that are required at
# runtime *and* to install dependencies like `ruby`. Then it builds images that
# intall those dependencies. Then it builds a "final" image that copies the
# dependencies and installs package that it needs at runtime. Compared to
# installing everything in one go this shrinks the "final" docker image by
# about 50%, mostly because we don't need things like `gcc` and `ruby-dev` in
# the "final" image.

# Debian builds the docs about 20% faster than alpine. The image is larger
# and takes longer to build but that is worth it.
