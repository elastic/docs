These are Elastic's extensions to Asciidoctor! The `lib` directory contains
the actual extensions and the spec directory contains the tests. You can run
the tests with `build_docs --self-test` to reproduce the authoritative, in
docker tests. You can also use more ruby standard stuff like:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rubocop
```

but it is not authoritative.
