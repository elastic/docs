:ref:  http://www.elastic.co/guide/elasticsearch/reference/current

== Conditions of use

This documentation build process is provided to the public purely for the
purpose of testing documentation changes before submitting pull requests to
the appropriate Elasticsearch repository.

The documents produced by this build process may be published only on
http://www.elastic.co. They may not be published in any other form or
on any other website without explicit permission.

[[setup]]
== Getting started

[float]
== Requirements

You'll need `bash` and `docker`.

[float]
== Cloning the repository

Clone the `docs` repository with:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
git clone git@github.com:elastic/docs.git
----------------------------

[float]
== Building this README

You can test that everything is working correctly by building
this README as follows:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
cd docs/
./build_docs --doc README.asciidoc --open
----------------------------

This should convert `README.asciidoc` into HTML and open it
in your browser.

[[build]]
= Building documentation

[partintro]
--
The `build_docs` executable can be used to build the documentation
from a locally checked out repository, or to build all the
documentation that will be uploaded to the website.
--

[[local]]
== For a local repo

When you are making changes to documentation in a locally checked
out repository, and you want to check that they are building
correctly, use `build_docs` with the `--doc` parameter to
generate the HTML version of the docs:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
cd path/to/your/repo
~/path/to/docs/repo/build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc
----------------------------

To use simplified aliases for the build commands for each book, see
`doc_build_aliases.sh`. 

=== Specifying a different output dir

By default, the HTML docs are generated in `./html_docs`. You can
change the output directory with the `--out` parameter:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc --out output/dir/
----------------------------

WARNING: The `output/dir/` will be deleted and recreated, so don't
point it at a directory that contains anything you are fond of.

=== Viewing the docs

To view the generated docs in your web browser immediately after
the build has finished, use the `--open` parameter:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc --open
----------------------------

=== Single- or multi-page

By default, the build process generates an HTML file per
part/chapter/section.  To generate all of the docs in a single
file instead, use the `--single` parameter:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc --single
----------------------------

And if you want a table of contents added at the beginning
of the single page output, add the `--toc` parameter:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc --single --toc
----------------------------

NOTE: The multi-page output always contains tables-of-content
where appropriate.

=== Chunking in the right place

Asciidoc combines all of the source files into one big file, which it converts
to a single XML file for DocBook to process.  _Chunking_ is the process of
breaking that XML file up into multiple HTML pages.

By default, each _part_ (`= Part Title`) and _chapter_ (`== Chapter Title`) is
"chunked" into a separate HTML file. However, for bigger books, such as the
Elasticsearch reference  docs, this results in enormous pages.  These bigger
books are also chunked at the first _section_ level (`=== Section One Title`).
This behaviour is specified in the https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml[`conf.yaml`]
file, but must also be specified on the command line when building a single
book:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc --chunk 1
----------------------------

== Correcting errors

Asciidoc is converted to DocBook, which is then converted to HTML.
DocBook is strict, which means that you have to follow the rules
(see <<asciidoc-guide>>) otherwise the build process will throw
an error.

The most common errors are:

* Asciidoc syntax error, eg `=Title` instead of `= Title` or
  unclosed block delimiters, ie `======` or `------`
* incorrect order of elements, eg `= Title` followed by
  a `=== Level 3` header
* Linking to an non-existent ID

Errors may be thrown either by Asciidoc or by DocBook.  Asciidoc errors refer
to the actual `.asciidoc` page where the error occurred,  but DocBook errors
only refer to a line in the generated XML file, and look something like this:

    path/to/index.xml:1518: element xref: validity error : XXXXX

The easiest way to debug these is to open the XML file (`index.xml` in the
example above) and navigate to the specified line number (`1518` in the
example above). This marks the *end* of the section containing the error.

== Building part of a book

Building a big book is time consuming.  Unfortunately, in order to test that
all links exist, the entire book needs to be built in one go.  However, while
you're writing docs it is useful to be able to build just a single `.asciidoc`
page.

You can do this by telling `build_docs` to ignore errors with the `--lenient`
parameter:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/some/page.asciidoc --lenient --single --open
----------------------------

If the page you are building contains links to content in other pages, the
above command will output warnings like:

    ERROR: xref linking to relevance-intro has no generated link text.

NOTE: You should still build the whole book without the `--lenient` parameter
before committing, to be sure that you haven't broken any links.

[[website]]
== For the website

Usually you don't need to build all the docs that will be uploaded
to the website, but if you are linking between documents (e.g.
between the Java API docs and the main reference documentation),
then building all of the docs will report any missing links.

You can build all the docs with:

[source,bash]
----------------------------
build_docs --all
----------------------------

The first time you run this will be slow as it needs to:

* clone each repository
* build the docs for each branch

Subsequent runs will pull any changes to the repos and only build the
branches that have changed.

NOTE: If you do not have authority to access all of the necessary repositories,
an error occurs during the cloning phase. 


=== Checking your changes

Because the docs are built from the remote repositories, you will
need to push your changes to the main repo before running
`build_docs --all`.

Assuming you have already checked that your docs build correctly
using the <<local,local build process>>, the only other errors
that might occur at this stage are bad cross-document links.

Once the docs build correctly, you don't need to do anything more.
The changes that you have pushed to your repository will be
picked up automatically by the docs build service.

[[config]]
== Adding new docs or new branches

The documentation that appears on the http://www.elastic.co/guide
website is controlled by the
https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml[`conf.yaml`] file in the `docs` repo.

You can add a new repository under the `repos` section, if it
doesn't already exist, and you can add a new "book" under the
`contents` section.

The `repos.$NAME.branches[]` key lists all of the branches which
should be built -- all of these branches will be available on the
website -- while `repos.$NAME.current` lists the branch which
should be used as the default version on the site.

NOTE: The `branches` and `current` settings can be overridden in
the config for each book.  For instance, the "Community Clients"
docs are built only from the `master` branch.

When you release a new version of your code, you need to add
a new `branch` to the config and to update the `current` branch
for your project.  Commit the change to https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml[`conf.yaml`] and push
to the remote `docs` repo.

[[asciidoc-guide]]
= Asciidoc Guide

[partintro]
--
Asciidoc is a powerful markup language that is easy to read as
plain text.  In general, it is pretty simple to use, but
there are some rules that you have to follow to ensure that
it generates valid DocBook output.

Below I include most of the Asciidoc syntax that you will
need.  For more, you can take a look at the
http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc Cheat Sheet],
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[Asciidoctor Quick Syntax]
or the official http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[Asciidoc User Guide].
--

[[structure]]
== Basic book structure

Asciidocs can be built as a `book`, `article`, `manpage` etc.
All our docs are built as a `book`, and thus follow the
layout for books.  The most basic structure is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= Book title                # level 0

== Chapter title            # level 1

=== Section title           # level 2

==== Section title          # level 3

===== Section title         # level 4
----------------------------------

Usually this structure will be sufficient for most of your
documentation needs. More complicated "books", such
as the {ref}[Elasticsearch reference docs], however,
require a few additional elements, described on the
following pages.

=== Filenames

By default, each chapter will generate a new _chunk_
or HTML file.  You can control the name of the file
by giving the header an ID, as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[intro-to-xyz]]
== Intro to XYZ
----------------------------------

This chapter would then be written to a file called
`intro-to-xyz.html`.  If no ID is provided, then a
filename will be auto-generated.  See <<chunking>>
for more.

These IDs are also used to link to sections within each
book.  See <<linking>>.

=== TOC titles

By default, the link text used in the generated TOC is
based on the title of each file. You can provide an
abbreviated title by using the DocBook `<titleabbrev>`
tag. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
== Intro to XYZ

++++
<titleabbrev>Intro</titleabbrev>
++++
----------------------------------

[[multi-part]]
== Multi-part books

Books may also be divided into multiple parts, which are indicated
with `level 0` headers:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= Book title                # level 0

= Part title                # level 0

== Chapter title            # level 1

=== Section title           # level 2

... etc ...
----------------------------------

Each `part` also creates a new _chunk_ or HTML file.

=== Part intro

A `part` may include text before the first `chapter`, but
it must be marked with `[partintro]` in order to be valid:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= Book title                # level 0

= Part one                  # level 0

[partintro]
A paragraph introducing this Part

== Chapter title            # level 1

... etc ...
----------------------------------

Longer `partintro` blocks should be wrapped in an
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#X29[_open block_]
which starts and ends with two dashes: `--`:

["source","asciidoc",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
----------------------------------
= Part two                  # level 0

[partintro]
.A partintro title
pass:[--] <1>
This section may contain multiple paragraphs.

[float]
== A header should use [float]

Everything up to the closing -- marker
will be considered part of the partintro.
pass:[--] <1>

== Chapter title           # level 2

... etc ...
----------------------------------

<1> The _open block_ delimiters

[[optional-sections]]
== Optional sections

Books may include other sections such as a _preamble_, a _preface_,
a _glossary_ or _appendices_.

=== Preamble

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= Book title                # level 0

.Optional preamble title
Preamble text...

----------------------------------

=== Preface and Appendix

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[preface]
= Preface title             # level 0

=== Preface header          # level 2 <1>

= Part one                  # level 0
----------------------------------

and

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[appendix]
= Appendix title            # level 0

=== Appendix header         # level 2 <1>
----------------------------------

<1> Any headers in the appendix or in the preface start
    out-of-sequence at `level 2`, not at `level 1`.

ifdef::asciidoctor[[section]]
ifndef::asciidoctor[[sect3]]
=== Glossary

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[glossary]
= Glossary title            # level 0

[glossary]
Term one::
    Defn for term one

Term two::
    Defn for term two
----------------------------------

[NOTE]
==================================
The two `[glossary]` elements above have different purposes:

 * The first marks this section of the document as a glossary, to be included in the table of contents
 * The second marks the definitions list as type `glossary`
==================================


=== Also see

If you need to use some of these more advanced structural
elements, have a look at the example of a multi-part book
included in this repo in https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/resources/asciidoc-8.6.8/doc/book-multi.txt[`resources/asciidoc-8.6.8/doc/book-multi.txt`].

[[paragraphs]]
== Paragraphs

A paragraph consists of multiple lines of text which start
in the left hand column:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
This is a paragraph
even though it contains
line breaks.

This is a second paragraph.
----------------------------------

=== Paragraph titles

Like most elements, a paragraph can have a title:

.Paragraph with a title
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
.Paragraph title
Text of my paragraph
----------------------------------

.Paragraph title
Text of my paragraph
==================================

[[admon-paras]]
=== Admonition paragraphs

A paragraph which starts with `TIP:`, `NOTE:`, `IMPORTANT:`,
`WARNING:` or `CAUTION:` is rendered as an _admonition_ paragraph,
eg:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
NOTE: Compare admonition paragraphs with <<admon-blocks>>.
----------------------------------

This renders as:

NOTE: Compare admonition paragraphs
with <<admon-blocks>>.

=== Literal paragraphs

Literal paragraphs, which are rendered as `<pre>`
blocks without any source highlighting, must be
indented:

.A literal paragraph
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
.Optional title

    This para must
    be indented
----------------------------------

.Optional title
    This para must
    be indented
==================================

See also <<code-blocks>> for blocks with
syntax highlighting.

[[text]]
== Inline text

Inline text can be formatted as follows:

[horizontal]
ifdef::env-github[]
`&#x5f;emphasis_`::         _emphasis_
`&#x2a;bold*`::             *bold*
`&#x60;mono'`::             `mono`
`&#x5e;superscript^`::      ^superscript^
`&#x7e;subscript~`::        ~subscript~
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
+&#x5f;emphasis_+::         _emphasis_
+&#x2a;bold*+::             *bold*
+&#x60;mono'+::             `mono`
+&#x5e;superscript^+::      ^superscript^
+&#x7e;subscript~+::        ~subscript~
endif::[]

These formatting characters expect to adjoin whitespace or
common punctuation characters.  To combine *bold* with emphasis,
double up the quotes (ie use `__` and `**`):

.Combining bold and emphasis
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
This example co__mb**in**es__ bold and emphasis
----------------------------------

This example co__mb**in**es__ bold and emphasis.
==================================

Unwanted quotes can be escaped with a `\` character.

=== Replacement characters

Certain runs of ASCII characters are replaced as follows:

[horizontal]
ifdef::env-github[]
`--`::        -- (em dash)
`&#x2e;..`::  ...
`&#x2d;>`::   ->
`<&#x2d;`::   <-
`&#x3d;>`::   =>
`<&#x3d;`::   <=
`&#x28;C)`::  (C)
`&#x28;TM)`:: (TM)
`&#x28;R)`::  (R)
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
+--+::        -- (em dash)
+&#x2e;..+::  ...
+&#x2d;>+::   ->
+<&#x2d;+::   <-
+&#x3d;>+::   =>
+<&#x3d;+::   <=
+&#x28;C)+::  (C)
+&#x28;TM)+:: (TM)
+&#x28;R)+::  (R)
endif::[]

[[linking]]
== Linking

You can link to any block in the document that has an ID -- an
identifier before the block which is wrapped in double
square brackets: `[[ID]]`

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[para-id]]
This paragraph can be linked to using the ID `para-id`.
----------------------------------

When you need to combine an ID with a _style_, you can
either specify each on a separate line:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[note-id]]
[NOTE]
===============================
This note can be linked to using the ID `note-id`.
===============================
----------------------------------

or in one line:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
["NOTE",id="note-id"] <1>
===============================
This note can be linked to using the ID `note-id`.
===============================
----------------------------------

<1> In the one line format, the `NOTE` must be enclosed
    in double quotes.

Both of the above render as:

["NOTE",id="note-id"]
===============================
This note can be linked to using the ID `note-id`.
===============================

The `ID` is added to the HTML document as an `<a>` anchor
and, as explained in <<chunking>>, the `ID` is used as the
filename for sections which are chunked -- written to
separate HTML files.

=== Internal links

You can link to any ID within a document using double
angle brackets:

.Links with default link text
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
* <<setup>>
* <<structure>>
* <<note-id>>
----------------------------------

* <<setup>>
* <<structure>>
* <<note-id>>
==================================

It will use the title associated with each ID as the
link text.  In the example above, `note-id` is not associated
with any title, which is why the text is rendered as `"Note"`.

Alternative link text can be provided as a second parameter
inside the angle brackets:

.Links with custom link text
==================================

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
See the <<note-id,note about IDs>>.
----------------------------------

See the <<note-id,note about IDs>>.

==================================

=== External links

Links to external websites can just be added as normal
inline text, optionally with custom link text in
square brackets:

.External links
==================================

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
See http://github.com/elastic
or  http://github.com/elastic/docs[this repository]
----------------------------------

See http://github.com/elastic
or  http://github.com/elastic/docs[this repository]

==================================

The existence of external links is not confirmed by
the build process.

=== Cross document links

Links to other Elasticsearch docs are essentially the
same as external links. However, for conciseness and
maintainability, you should use an _attribute_ to
represent the absolute URL of the docs.

If possible, use attributes defined in the
https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/shared/attributes.asciidoc[shared
attributes file] to resolve links:

.Using shared attributes for cross-document linking
==================================

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= My Book Title

\include::{asciidoc-dir}/../../shared/attributes.asciidoc[]

Here is a link to the {ref}/search.html[search page]
----------------------------------

Here is a link to the {ref}/search.html[search page]
==================================


For books that don't use the
https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/shared/attributes.asciidoc[shared
attributes file], the attributes appear at the beginning of the docs, under the
book title:

.Using book-scoped attributes for cross-document linking
==================================

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= My Book Title
:ref:  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current

Here is a link to the {ref}/search.html[search page]
----------------------------------

Here is a link to the {ref}/search.html[search page]
==================================

The main benefit of using attributes for cross document links is
that, when the docs for an old version contain links that
no longer exist in the `current` branch, you can update
all the links in the document to point to the older version,
by just updating a single attribute.

Cross document links are checked when `build_docs` is
run with the `--all` parameter.  See <<website>>.

[[lists]]
== Lists

=== Bullet points

Bullet point lists are written using asterisks:

.Bullet points
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
.Optional title
* Point
* Point
** Sub-point
*** Sub-sub-point
* A point can have multiple paragraphs
+
But use a `+` instead of an empty line between paras.

An empty line signifies the end of the list.
----------------------------------

.Optional title
* Point
* Point
** Sub-point
** Sub-point
* A point can have multiple paragraphs
+
But use a `+` instead of an empty line between paras

An empty line signifies the end of the list.
==================================

=== Ordered lists

Ordered lists use `.` instead of `*`, and will alternate
between numbers and letters automatically:

.An ordered list
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
.Optional title
. foo
.. bar
... baz
.... balloo
----------------------------------

.Optional title
. foo
.. bar
... baz
.... balloo
==================================

Alternatively, you can control whether it uses a number
or a letter as follows:

.Controlling the counters
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
a. Start with a letter
b. Another letter
  1. Now numbers
  2.  And more numbers
----------------------------------

a. Start with a letter
b. Another letter
  1. Now numbers
  2. And more numbers
==================================

=== Definition lists

Definition lists are used to define terms. The term must be
followed by a double colon `::` eg:

.A vertical definition list
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
term one::      Definition for term one
term two::
                Can start on the next line
term three::    A definition can have multiple
+
paragraphs, but use `+` to separate them

term four:::    Definitions can be nested
                by adding more colons
term five::     A definition can even include
                lists:
                * point one
                * point two
----------------------------------

term one::      Definition for term one
term two::
                Can start on the next line
term three::    A definition can have multiple
+
paragraphs, but use `+` to separate them

term four:::    Definitions can be nested
                by adding more colons
term five::     A definition can even include
                lists:
                * point one
                * point two
==================================

[[horizonta-defn-list]]
=== Horizontal definition lists

Often definition lists are better rendered
horizontally, eg:

.A horizontal definition list
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[horizontal]
term one::      Definition for term one
term two::
                Can start on the next line
term three::    A definition can have multiple
+
paragraphs, but use `+` to separate them

term four:::    Definitions can be nested
                by adding more colons
term five::     A definition can even include
                lists:
                * point one
                * point two
----------------------------------

[horizontal]
term one::      Definition for term one
term two::
                Can start on the next line
term three::    A definition can have multiple
+
paragraphs, but use `+` to separate them

term four:::    Definitions can be nested
                by adding more colons
term five::     A definition can even include
                lists:
                * point one
                * point two
==================================

[[blocks]]
== Blocks

Blocks are used for special blocks of content, such as
<<code-blocks>>, <<examples>>, <<sidebars>> and
<<admon-blocks>>.

Blocks are delimited with a start and end line which uses
the same characters, like `=====`.

[[code-blocks]]
=== Code blocks

Code blocks are rendered as `<pre>` blocks, and use
syntax highlighting, eg:

.A code block
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
--
.Optional title
[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
    "query": "foo bar"
}
----------------------------------
--

.Optional title
[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
    "query": "foo bar"
}
----------------------------------
==================================

IMPORTANT: The language to use for source highlighting
-- eg `js` above -- *must* be specified, otherwise Asciidoc
emits invalid DocBook.

=== Callouts

Code blocks can use _callouts_ to add an explanatory
footnote to a particular line of code:

.Code block with callouts
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
--
[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
    "query": "foo bar" \<1>
}
----------------------------------

\<1> Here's the explanation
--

[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
    "query": "foo bar" <1>
}
----------------------------------

<1> Here's the explanation
==================================

[[console-snippets]]
=== View in Console

Code blocks can be followed by a "View in Console" link which, when clicked,
will open the code snippet in Console. There are two ways to do this, the
"AsciiDoc" way and the "Asciidoctor" way. The "AsciiDoc" way is preferred in
the Elaticsearch repository because it can recognize it to make tests. The
"Asciidoctor" way is preferred in other books, but only if they are built with
"Asciidoctor". Try it first and if it works then use it. Otherwise, use the
"AsciiDoc" way.

////

The tricks that we pull to make ascidoctor support // CONSOLE are windy
and force us to add subs=+macros when we render an asciidoc snippet.
We *don't* require that for normal snippets, just those that contain
asciidoc.

////

.Code block with CONSOLE link (AsciiDoc way)
==================================
ifdef::asciidoctor[[source,asciidoc,subs=+macros]]
ifndef::asciidoctor[[source,asciidoc]]
--
[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": "foo bar" \<1>
}
----------------------------------
// CONSOLE <1>

\<1> Here's the explanation
--
==================================
<1> The `// CONSOLE` line must follow immediately after the code block, before any callouts.

.Code block with CONSOLE link (Asciidoctor way)
==================================
[source,asciidoc]
--
[source,console]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": "foo bar" \<1>
}
----------------------------------

\<1> Here's the explanation
--
==================================

Both render as:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": "foo bar" <1>
}
----------------------------------
// CONSOLE

<1> Here's the explanation

[NOTE]
================================
The "View in Console" links will only work if the docs are viewed in web-browser mode, as follows:

[source,sh]
---------------
build_docs -d my_doc.asciidoc --open <1>
---------------
<1> The `--open` option usually opens the docs in the web browser, served directly from the file system.

The local web browser can be stopped with `Ctrl-C`.

================================

[[admon-blocks]]
=== Admonition blocks

Admonition blocks are much the same as <<admon-paras>>, except that
they can be longer and contain more than just a paragraph.
For instance:


[source,asciidoc]
--
[NOTE]
=========================
This note contains a list:

* foo
* bar
* baz

and some code

[source,js]
----------------------------------
{ "query": "foo bar"}
----------------------------------
=========================
--

This renders as:

[NOTE]
=========================
This note contains a list:

* foo
* bar
* baz

and some code

[source,js]
----------------------------------
{ "query": "foo bar"}
----------------------------------
=========================

[[sidebars]]
=== Sidebars

Sidebars are used to highlight a block of
content that is outside the usual flow of text:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
.Optional title
**********************************
So why does the `bulk` API have such a
funny format?  Sit down and I'll tell you
all about it!
**********************************
----------------------------------

.Optional title
**********************************
So why does the `bulk` API have such a
funny format?  Sit down and I'll tell you
all about it!
**********************************


[[examples]]
=== Example blocks

Example blocks contain normal text which is used as an
example.  The title, if any, is labelled as an example
and numbered:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
.My first example
========================================
Text explaining the first example.
========================================

.My second example
========================================
Text explaining the second example.
========================================
----------------------------------

This renders as:

.My first example
========================================
Text explaining the first example.
========================================

.My second example
========================================
Text explaining the second example.
========================================

CAUTION: The `===` and `---` delimiters can
sometimes be confused with a header, resulting
in an error.  To resolve this, add newlines
between the delimiter and the content
before and after it.

[[includes]]
== Including files

For long documentation, you probably want to break up
the Asciidoc files into smaller units, and just
include them where appropriate:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
\include::myfolder/mydoc.asciidoc[]

----------------------------------

Paths are relative to the file which
contains the `include` statement.

[[changes]]
== Additions and deprecations

Documentation is built for various branches, eg `0.90`,
`1.00`, `master`.  However, we release versions
`0.90.0`, `0.90.1`, etc, which are all based on the
`0.90` branch.

When adding new functionality to a branch, or deprecating
existing functionality, you can mark the change as
_added_, _coming_ or _deprecated_. Use `coming` when the addition is
in an as yet unreleased version of the current branch, and `added` when
the functionality is already released.

The `update_versions.pl` script can be used to change `coming` notices
to `added` notices when doing a new release, and can also be used
to remove `added`, `coming` and `deprecated` notices completely.


=== Inline notifications

Use inline notifications for small changes, such as
the addition or deprecation of individual parameters.

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[horizontal]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. added[0.90.4]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. coming[0.90.4]
`foo.baz`::   Does XYZ. deprecated[0.90.4]
----------------------------------

[horizontal]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. added[0.90.4]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. coming[0.90.4]
`foo.baz`::   Does XYZ. deprecated[0.90.4]

You can also include details about additional
notes in the notifications which show up when the
user hovers over it:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[horizontal]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. added[0.90.4,Replaces `foo.baz`]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. coming[0.90.4,Replaces `foo.baz`]
`foo.baz`::   Does XYZ. deprecated[0.90.4,Replaced by `foo.bar`]
----------------------------------

[horizontal]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. added[0.90.4,Replaces `foo.baz`]
`foo.bar`::   Does XYZ. coming[0.90.4,Replaces `foo.baz`]
`foo.baz`::   Does XYZ. deprecated[0.90.4,Replaced by `foo.bar`]

=== Section notifications

Use section notifications to mark an entire chapter or
section as _added_/_deleted_.  Notifications can just refer
to the version in which the change was made:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
==== New section

added[0.90.4]

Text about new functionality...

==== New section not yet released

coming[0.90.9]

Text about new functionality...

==== Old section

deprecated[0.90.4]

Text about old functionality...
----------------------------------

==== New section

added[0.90.4]

Text about new functionality...

==== New section not yet released

coming[0.90.9]

Text about new functionality...

==== Old section

deprecated[0.90.4]

Text about old functionality...

==== With details...

Or they can include extra text, including more
Asciidoc markup:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[new-section]]
==== New section

added[0.90.4,Replaces `foo.bar`. See <<old-section>>]

Text about new functionality...

[[coming-section]]
==== New section not yet released

coming[0.90.9,Replaces `foo.bar`. See <<old-section>>]

Text about new functionality...

[[old-section]]
==== Old section

deprecated[0.90.4,Replace by `foo.baz`. See <<new-section>>]

Text about old functionality...
----------------------------------

[[new-section]]
==== New section

added[0.90.4,Replaces `foo.bar`. See <<old-section>>]

Text about new functionality...

[[old-section]]
==== Old section

deprecated[0.90.4,Replace by `foo.baz`. See <<new-section>>]

Text about old functionality...

[[experimental]]
== Experimental and Beta

APIs or parameters that are experimental or in beta can be marked as such, using
markup similar to that used in <<changes>>.  For instance:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[new-feature]]
=== New experimental feature

experimental[]

experimental[Custom text goes here]

Text about new feature...

[[old-feature]]
=== Established feature

This feature has been around for a while, but we're adding
a new experimental parameter:

[horizontal]
`established_param`::  This param has been around for ages and won't change.
`experimental_param`:: experimental[] This param is experimental and may change in the future.
`experimental_param`:: experimental[Custom text goes here] This param is experimental and may change in the future.

----------------------------------

[[new-feature]]
=== New experimental feature

experimental[]

experimental[Custom text goes here]

Text about new feature...

[[old-feature]]
=== Established feature

This feature has been around for a while, but we're adding
a new experimental parameter:

[horizontal]
`established_param`::  This param has been around for ages and won't change.
`experimental_param`:: experimental[] This param is experimental and may change in the future.
`experimental_param`:: experimental[Custom text goes here] This param is experimental and may change in the future.

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[new-beta-feature]]
=== New beta feature

beta[]

beta[Custom text goes here]

Text about new feature...

[[old-beta-feature]]
=== Established feature

This feature has been around for a while, but we're adding
a new beta parameter:

[horizontal]
`established_param`::  This param has been around for ages and won't change.
`beta_param`:: beta[] This param is beta and may change in the future.
`beta_param`:: beta[Custom text goes here] This param is beta and may change in the future.

----------------------------------

[[new-beta-feature]]
=== New beta feature

beta[]

beta[Custom text goes here]

Text about new feature...

[[old-beta-feature]]
=== Established feature

This feature has been around for a while, but we're adding
a new beta parameter:

[horizontal]
`established_param`::  This param has been around for ages and won't change.
`beta_param`:: beta[] This param is experimental and may change in the future.
`beta_param`:: beta[Custom text goes here] This param is beta and may change in the future.

[[images]]
== Images

Any images you want to include should be saved in a folder
in your repo, and included using a path relative
to the document where the `image::` statement appears.

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[cat]]
.A scaredy cat
image::resources/cat.jpg[Alt text]

A link to <<cat>>
----------------------------------

[[cat]]
.A scaredy cat
image::resources/cat.jpg[Alt text]

A link to <<cat>>

=== Width and height

The `width` and/or `height` of the image can be
specified in pixels or as a percentage:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=50]
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width="20%"]
----------------------------------

image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=50]
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width="20%"]

=== Alignment

Images are left-aligned by default, but they can
be centred or right-aligned:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=100,align="left"]
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=100,align="right"]
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=100,align="center"]
----------------------------------

image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=100,align="left"]
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=100,align="right"]
image::resources/cat.jpg["Alt text",width=100,align="center"]

[[tables]]
== Tables

In general, tables are frowned upon in DocBook as they
don't display well in formats other than HTML, eg PDF,
ePub, etc.

It's almost always better to use <<horizonta-defn-list>>
instead, but if you really want to use tables, you
can read about them http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#_tables[here].


[[chunking]]
== Controlling chunking

In <<structure>>, we said that each `part` or `chapter` generates
a new _chunk_ or HTML file.  For more complex documentation,
you may want the first level of ++section++s to also generate
new chunks.

For instance, in the ES reference docs, we have:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
= Search APIs               # part

== Request body search      # chapter

=== Query                   # section level 1

=== From/Size               # section level 1

... etc ...
----------------------------------

There are too many parameters for "Request body search"
to list them all on one page.  In this case, it
is worth turning on chunking for top level sections.

=== Enabling section chunking

To enable section chunking when building docs in a <<local,local repository>>,
pass the `--chunk` parameter:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
build_docs --doc path/to/index.asciidoc --chunk 1
----------------------------------

To enable section chunking when building docs <<website,for the website>>,
add `chunk: 1` to the
https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml[`conf.yaml`] file in the `docs` repo.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
contents:
    -
        title:      Elasticsearch reference
        prefix:     elasticsearch/reference
        repo:       elasticsearch
        index:      docs/reference/index.asciidoc
        chunk:      1 <1>
----------------------------------

<1> Chunking is enabled for this book

=== Chunking selected sections

If you enable session chunking, you will probably find
that you have a few short sections which you want to keep on
the same page.

To do this, you can use the `[float]` marker before a
section header, to tell Asciidoc that what follows isn't
a "real" header:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------
[[chapter-one]]
== chapter               # new chunk

[[section-one]]
=== Section one         # new chunk

[[section-two]]
[float]
=== Section two         # same chunk

[[section-three]]
=== Section three       # new chunk
----------------------------------

The above would produce three HTML files,
named for their IDs:

* `chapter-one.html`
* `section-one.html` which would also contain
  "Section two"
* `section-three.html`

To link to "Section two" from an external
document, you would use the URL: `section-one.html#section-two`
